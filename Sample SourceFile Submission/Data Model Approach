Data model Approach:
	For the data model i used a simple approach in with the the data is stored in a star schema with 3 dimensions containing the station, country and datetime details in each and a fact containing the details of each train (like source, destination names, datetime, passenger deman(target)).
as for the analysis for etl i used python only. I have created the separate dataframes for each dimension and fact which can then be loaded into tables of any kind of relational databases like oracle, sql server or mysql.
for any new data, we can use scd-type1 or scd-type2 approaches for the dimensional data depending on the requirement. Below i am giving more details about the data model.

Facts:
	train_detail:
		train_id	(unique id to represent the each row of the table)-(Primary Key)
		id_code		(id_code given in the dataset for each row)
		train_name	(Name of the train)
		datetime	(Date and time at which the train was started)-(Foriegn key to Datetime_Detail Dimension)
		Source 		(Source station)-(Foriegn key to Station_detail Dimension)
		destination	(Destination Station)-(Foriegn key to Station_detail Dimension)
		target		(The passenger demand for that train at that time either high, low or medium)

Dimensions:
	datetime_detail:
		id			(unique id to represent the each row of the table)-(Primary Key)
		datetime	(date and time)
		day			(day for the datetime)
		hours		(hour for the datetime)
		minutes		(minutes for the datetime)
		is_weekend	(whether the day is weekend or not)
		
	country_code:
		id			(unique id to represent the each row of the table)-(Primary Key)
		country_code(Country Code)
		
	station_detail:
		id				(unique id to represent the each row of the table)-(Primary Key)
		name			(Name of the station)
		country_code	(Country code to which the station belongs)
		mean_halt_times	(Mean of Halt times for the station)
		latitude		(Latitude of the station)
		Longitude		(Longitude of the station)
